1. Clone the GitHub repository

git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

2. Add GitLab as a second remote

git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/username/repo-name.git
You can verify with:
git remote -v

3. Create a new branch (optional if already working in one)

git checkout -b new-branch-name


4. Push to GitLab as a new branch

git push gitlab new-branch-name
This pushes the current branch to GitLab under that branch name.

5. Optional: Push tags or all branches
If needed:

git push gitlab --tags     # Push tags
git push gitlab --all      # Push all branches

✅ Example scenario:
You updated main on GitHub and want it as updated-main in GitLab:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo
git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/user/repo.git
git checkout -b updated-main
git push gitlab upgithdated-main
