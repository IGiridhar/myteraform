Here's a detailed guide on configuring Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) in PostgreSQL 17 with a master and standby setup:
Understanding PITR
PostgreSQL's Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) lets you restore your database to a specific point in time. It works by combining:
Base backups: Full copies of your database's data files.
Write-Ahead Logs (WAL): A record of every change made to the database.
By replaying the WAL files from a base backup, you can reconstruct the database's state at any point in time after that backup.
Steps to Configure PITR
Here's a breakdown of the configuration process:
1. Configure WAL Archiving on the Master Server
Edit postgresql.conf:
Locate your PostgreSQL configuration file. (e.g., /etc/postgresql/17/main/postgresql.conf)
Modify these parameters:
wal_level = replica  # or logical
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'test ! -f /path/to/wal_archive/%f && cp %p /path/to/wal_archive/%f'
max_wal_senders = 5
wal_keep_size = 1GB


wal_level: Set to replica for replication and PITR. If using logical replication, use logical.
archive_mode: Enables WAL archiving.
archive_command: Specifies how WAL files are archived.
Replace /path/to/wal_archive/ with your desired archive location. Make sure this directory exists, is writable by the postgres user, and is on storage you trust.
%p is the path to the WAL file.
%f is the WAL filename.
The test ! -f ... && prevents overwriting existing files.
max_wal_senders: The maximum number of concurrent connections for replication and backups.
wal_keep_size: The minimum size of WAL files kept in pg_wal.
Create the Archive Directory:
sudo mkdir -p /path/to/wal_archive
sudo chown postgres:postgres /path/to/wal_archive
sudo chmod 700 /path/to/wal_archive


Restart PostgreSQL:
sudo systemctl restart postgresql@17-main.service # Adjust the service name if needed


Verify Archiving: Check the PostgreSQL logs on the master to confirm WAL files are being archived.
2. Take a Base Backup
Use pg_basebackup from the standby server (or another client) to create a base backup:
pg_basebackup -h <master_host> -p 5432 -U <replication_user> -D /var/lib/postgresql/17/main -R -Fp -Xs -P


<master_host>: Hostname or IP of the master server.
5432: PostgreSQL port.
<replication_user>: A user with the REPLICATION attribute. Create on the master if needed:
CREATE ROLE replication_user WITH REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';


/var/lib/postgresql/17/main: The (empty) data directory on the standby server.
-R: Creates standby.signal and postgresql.auto.conf for the standby.
-Fp: Plain format.
-Xs: Start streaming WAL during the backup.
-P: Show progress.
3. Configure the Standby Server
The pg_basebackup -R command usually sets up the standby correctly with a postgresql.auto.conf file. If you need to do this manually, here's what's needed.
Important: The standby server needs to be able to access the WAL archive. This might be via shared storage (like NFS), or by some other method of copying the files.
Check or Create postgresql.auto.conf: This file, in the standby's data directory, contains the connection settings.
Standby Configuration (usually in postgresql.auto.conf):
standby_mode = on
primary_conninfo = 'host=<master_host> port=5432 user=<replication_user> password=your_password application_name=standby'
restore_command = 'cp /path/to/wal_archive/%f %p'
trigger_file = '/tmp/promote'


standby_mode = on: Designates this server as a standby.
primary_conninfo: Connection string to the master.
restore_command: How the standby retrieves archived WAL files. Crucially, this path (/path/to/wal_archive/) must be correct on the standby server.
trigger_file: A file that, when created, promotes the standby to master (for failover).
4. Start the Standby Server
Start the PostgreSQL service on the standby:
sudo systemctl start postgresql@17-main.service


Testing PITR
Verify Replication:
Check PostgreSQL logs on both servers.
On the master, use SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication; to see the standby's connection.
Simulate Failure and Recover:
Determine Recovery Point: Find a time before the data loss you want to simulate.
Stop Standby: sudo systemctl stop postgresql@17-main.service (on standby).
Create recovery.conf: On the standby server, in the data directory. If postgresql.auto.conf exists, rename it.
standby_mode = off
recovery_target_time = '2024-08-28 10:00:00 EDT'  # Replace with your target time
restore_command = 'cp /path/to/wal_archive/%f %p' # Make sure this is correct


Start in Recovery Mode: sudo systemctl start postgresql@17-main.service (on standby). The server will recover to the specified time.
Verify: Connect to the standby and check the data.
Promote (if needed): If the master is down, create the trigger_file: touch /tmp/promote
Important Notes
WAL Archive Location: This is critical. It must be reliable, have enough space, and be accessible during recovery.
Security: Secure your WAL archive. It contains your database's history.
Base Backups: Take regular base backups in addition to WAL archiving. This speeds up recovery.
Backup Retention: Have a policy for how long to keep base backups and WAL files.
Testing: Test your recovery process regularly!
PostgreSQL 17: PostgreSQL 17 has improvements, including incremental backups, which can make backups more efficient. Investigate those for a long-term strategy.
